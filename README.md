# Summary
This application is a Quality of Life Research tool to find the ins and outs of a new or unfamiliar city. In this application, one can search any city in the United States and specify if they want to find food, medical, attractions, parks, stores, or all of the above. 

In order to create this application, we used the Google Maps API. Through this, we created five different maps for food, medical, attractions, parks, and stores. Each map uses an API function to pull that specific information from the Google Maps API.

When using the application, the user can enter in their city in the search bar provided, and choose from a dropdown to find their particular state.

Then, they can also choose from a second dropdown that lists each type of map they can look at: Food, Attractions, Stores, Parks, or Medical

Upon searching for their city, state, and specific needs,

A map will appear with the chosen elements present in that particular area. Additionally, we used local storage to show the search history below the search bar as seen below.
